## 2. Personal Story

Growing up in Kenya, I experienced firsthand the challenges of finding accurate and detailed information about higher education institutions and the courses they offered. After completing high school, I struggled to decide on the best university and course to pursue. This lack of accessible information inspired me to create a solution that would simplify the decision-making process for future students. My project, Campus Explorer Kenya, is aimed at helping students make informed choices about their education and career paths. Through this project, I hope to bridge the information gap and provide a valuable resource for Kenyan students.

## 4. Most Difficult Technical Challenge

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring the seamless integration of data from multiple sources. Hereâ€™s how I tackled it:

**Situation:** I needed to aggregate data from various sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information about universities, courses, and market skills.  
**Task:** Integrate data from disparate sources into a specified campus in accordance with the specific courses it offers while maintaining accuracy and consistency.  
**Action:** I decided to use a combination of web scraping and APIs to gather data. For web scraping, I used R programming library rvest and dplyr. I also developed custom APIs to retrieve data from reliable sources. Data validation and cleaning processes were implemented to ensure accuracy.  
**Result:** Successfully integrated a reliable and comprehensive database that serves the needs of our users, providing accurate information about universities, courses, and market skills. This integration ensures that users have access to the most current and relevant information.
